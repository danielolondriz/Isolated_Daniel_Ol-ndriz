Althoug a commit was made by the User Vulpem, it was me, from a computer of the Univerity that had another name logged in

5 items can be found in this game: two in the shop, the bag in the Haunted House, the crowbar in the ferris wheel, and the knife in the roller coaster.


SPECIAL FEATURES 

We commented that this game special features would be using a flashlight to get it some rooms, and the abilty to travel through train stations if the player owns a ticket.

ZORK 1 NOTES

NOTE: "Restructuration of code" and "Big changes: All iterations added" commits were made a day before, so they should be between "almost all instructions done" and "updated readme" commits in the timeline.

NOTE: The door is located in the Shop.
